#Plinio
Plinio is a very basic CMS for long texts on the web, with lots of multimedia elements and interactive animations. The idea is to make a simple article inspired by "Snow fall" by The New York Times.

You'll need only a server with PHP5 support and FTP access.

The name "Plinio" comes from Gaius Plinius Secundus, one of the first science writers and journalists.
